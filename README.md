## Elaine Archbold Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a portfolio site for amateur photographer Ritchie Hogan. Ritchie has built up a collection of work over the past couple of years. He currently displays his work through his Instagram feed, but in the future would like to run a website where he would be able to offer prints of his photos for sale.
He is in the process of increasing his follower numbers on Instagram but would like to utilise more social media channels and drive traffic to this website.
